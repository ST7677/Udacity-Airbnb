## Installation

The code in the project can be executed using Anaconda distribution of Python ver 3.x and does not require any additional scripts.


## Project motivation
I took up writing this blog as part of second term of the nanodegree [become a data scientist](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) of [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/). 
I was particular interested in identifying what are main factors influencing accomodation prices in Seattle to rent through [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).  


## File descriptions
There are 4 files available in the project
1. Readme.md (this file)
2. Seattle_airbnb.ipynb (the python Notebook)
3. Calendar.csv (data file about booking information in Seattle)
4. Listings.csv (data file about Information about the houses in Seattle)

## Results
With my analysis of the shared data I found out that
1. The peak season is June, July, August. 
2. The rates are higher on weekends
3. Number of rooms is the most significant factor in determining the price of rooms, followed by the neighborhood.
4. The highest demand is for 6 to 10 person occupancy houses.
