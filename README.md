## Installation

The code in the project can be executed using Anaconda distribution of Python ver 3.x and does not require any additional scripts.


## Project motivation
I took up writing this blog as part of second term of the nanodegree [become a data scientist](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) of [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/). 
I was particular interested in identifying what are main factors influencing accomodation prices in Seattle to rent through [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).  

The findings of the project are publish at https://medium.com/@sunilthakur_67045/analysis-of-2016-airbnb-offering-in-seattle-16e524e58c93


## File descriptions
There are 4 files available in the project
1. Readme.md (this file)
2. Seattle_airbnb.ipynb (the python Notebook)
3. Calendar.csv (data file about booking information in Seattle). This is truncated 19MB version of original 35MB file, due to GitHub file upload size limitation.
4. Listings.csv (data file about Information about the houses in Seattle)

## Results
With my analysis of the shared data I found out that
1. The peak season is from June to August and are lowest is from January to March
2. The rates are higher on weekends
3. Apartments and Houses comprise of about 90% of total listings
4. Neighborhoods of Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay and Westlake have highest mean price, while the neighborhoods of Rainier Beach, Olympic Hills and South Delridge have lowest mean prices
5. Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford have highest listing counts, while neighborhoods of Roxhill, South Park and Pinehurst have lower listing counts
6. Accommodation size (determined by number of bedrooms, how many people it accommodates, number of bathrooms) is by far the single biggest price influencer.
